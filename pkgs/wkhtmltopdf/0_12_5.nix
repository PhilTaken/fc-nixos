# wkhtmltopdf is a weird beast.
#
# Most of the functionality is derived from an older QT version providing
# webkit applied with a bunch of fixes that never made it upstream.
#
# See https://wkhtmltopdf.org/status.html for details and whether things have
# changed.
#
# For the 0.12 release series we came to the conclusion that we simply have to
# use the patched QT version - otherwise weird output bugs will creep in.
#
# NixOS already provides a patched built of QT 4, some of which are already
# applied in the patched QT version from wkhtmltopdf, so we deselect those.
#
# Previously (before this solution here) we thought that individual versions
# of wkhtmltopdf like 0.12.3, 0.12.4, 0.12.5 had different bugs that users
# were experiencing, but the "patched QT" fix seems to have shown us that
# NixOS (and our own builds) didn't properly include the patched QT version
# all the time.
#
# As a history of this code, here are the bugs we had in our hands:
#
# * #128175 triggered a full review of this code and has shown us that
#   we maybe do not need pin the versions but need to be careful about
#   including the right version of QT.
