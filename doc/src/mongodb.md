# MongoDB

:::{warning}
MongoDB is currently not supported on NixOS 23.11.
We will bring back older MongoDB versions (up to and including 4.2) for upgrading purposes only.
As a long-term solution we are evaluating [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.com/) which builds on PostgreSQL
and is compatible to MongoDB for many use cases.
